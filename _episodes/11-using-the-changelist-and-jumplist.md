### The Changelist

The changelist remembers the position of every change that can be undone. You can move back and forwards through the changelist using the commands:

    g;
    g,

You can view the contents of the changelist by running the command:

    :changes

### The Jumplist

Vim also maintains a jumplist, remembering each position to which the cursor jumped, rather than scrolled. You can move backwards and forwards through the jumplist with the commands:

    ctrl-O
    ctrl-I

You can view the contents of the jumplist by issuing the command:

    :jumps

When you are browsing Vim's documentation, you can follow the link under the cursor with the command:

    ctrl-]
