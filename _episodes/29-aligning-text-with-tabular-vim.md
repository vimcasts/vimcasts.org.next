There are times when you can improve the readability of your code by lining up the elements on neighbouring lines. In this episode, I demonstrate how this can be achieved using the [Tabular][t] plugin.

In this episode, I introduce the [Tabular.vim][t] plugin, by [Matt Wozniski][matt], which makes it easy to align regions of text that match a pattern.

### Aligning assignments ###

Before:

```ruby
one = 1
two = 2
three = 3
four = 4
```

Running `:Tab /=` produces:

```ruby
one   = 1
two   = 2
three = 3
four  = 4
```

### Colon assignments ###

There are a couple of different ways that colon assignments could be aligned. If we start with an example that is not aligned:

```javascript
var video = {
    metadata: {
        title: "Aligning assignments"
        h264Src: "/media/alignment.mov",
        oggSrc: "/media/alignment.ogv"
        posterSrc: "/media/alignment.png"
        duration: 320,
    }
}
```

Select the inner block by positioning your cursor inside it and running `vi}` (enable _V_isual mode, and select _i_nner _B_race). Then you could run `:Tab/:` which would produce this result:

```javascript
var video = {
    metadata: {
        title     : "Aligning assignments"
        h264Src   : "/media/alignment.mov",
        oggSrc    : "/media/alignment.ogv"
        posterSrc : "/media/alignment.png"
        duration  : 320,
    }
}
```

If you don't like stacking the colons in a column, you could use the [`\zs`][zs] atom to exclude the `:` character from the search match. Running `:Tab /:\zs` produces this result:

```javascript
var video = {
    metadata: {
        title:      "Aligning assignments"
        h264Src:    "/media/alignment.mov",
        oggSrc:     "/media/alignment.ogv"
        posterSrc:  "/media/alignment.png"
        duration:   320,
    }
}
```

Be aware that if you work in a team, there may be a house style that you should follow.

### Table markup ###

Here is a scenario outline for cucumber steps, including a pipe-delimited table of examples:

    Scenario Outline: eating
      Given there are &lt;start&gt; cucumbers
      When I eat &lt;eat&gt; cucumbers
      Then I should have &lt;left&gt; cucumbers

      Examples:
        |start|eat|left|
        |12|5|7|
        |20|5|15|

With the cursor positioned anywhere in the table, running `:Tab/|` produces:

    Scenario Outline: eating
      Given there are &lt;start&gt; cucumbers
      When I eat &lt;eat&gt; cucumbers
      Then I should have &lt;left&gt; cucumbers

      Examples:
        | start | eat | left |
        | 12    | 5   | 7    |
        | 20    | 5   | 15   |

## Creating mappings

If you find yourself using a particular token for alignment often, then you might want to save yourself a few keystrokes by creating mappings for normal and visual modes. Here are a few suggestions to get you started:

```viml
    let mapleader=','
    if exists(":Tabularize")
      nmap <Leader>a= :Tabularize /=<CR>
      vmap <Leader>a= :Tabularize /=<CR>
      nmap <Leader>a: :Tabularize /:\zs<CR>
      vmap <Leader>a: :Tabularize /:\zs<CR>
    endif
```

If you were in normal or visual mode, you could type `,a=` to align equals signs. In visual mode, the alignment would apply to the selected lines, but in normal mode tabular would attempt to guess the range.

You could take it a step further, by creating an insert mode mapping to trigger the `:Tabular` command when you type the character that you want to align. Tim Pope shows us how in this [gist][]:

```viml
inoremap <silent> <Bar>   <Bar><Esc>:call <SID>align()<CR>a

function! s:align()
  let p = '^\s*|\s.*\s|\s*$'
  if exists(':Tabularize') && getline('.') =~# '^\s*|' && (getline(line('.')-1) =~# p || getline(line('.')+1) =~# p)
    let column = strlen(substitute(getline('.')[0:col('.')],'[^|]','','g'))
    let position = strlen(matchstr(getline('.')[0:col('.')],'.*|\s*\zs.*'))
    Tabularize/|/l1
    normal! 0
    call search(repeat('[^|]*|',column).'\s\{-\}'.repeat('.',position),'ce',line('.'))
  endif
endfunction
```

If you put this in your vimrc file, then it will call the `:Tabularize` command each time you insert a `|` character.
