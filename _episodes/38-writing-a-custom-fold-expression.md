With a little bit of Vimscript, you can create a custom folding expression for any filetype. We'll start by looking at the mechanics of folding with markers, then go on to create a folding expression for markdown documents.

Here's [a gist of the markdown folding expression][gist] that was created in the video. 

## Creating an ftplugin

Create a filetype plugin for markdown files as follows:

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/markdown
    vim ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/markdown/folding.vim

You can replace `markdown` with the name of any other language to create a filetype plugin for that language instead.

## The mechanics of a `foldexpr`

Here's the boilerplate fold expression that we used to begin with:

```viml
function! MarkdownFolds()
  return "0"
endfunction
setlocal foldmethod=expr
setlocal foldexpr=MarkdownFolds()
```

It works like this: the `MarkdownFolds()` function is called one time *for each line* in the document. If the function returns `"0"`, it indicates that the line is not part of a fold. If the function returns `"1"`, it indicates that the line has a fold level of one. Here are a few more values that can be returned from a fold expression, with their meanings:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>value</th>
        <th>meaning</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>"0"</code></td>
        <td>the line is not in a fold</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>"1", "2", ...</code></td>
        <td>the line is in a fold with this level</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>"="</code></td>
        <td>use fold level from the previous line</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>"&gt;1", "&gt;2"</code></td>
        <td>a fold with this level starts at this line</td>
    </tr>
</table>

For a complete list of values that can be returned by a fold expression, look up [`:help fold-expr`][fold-expr].

Inside of a fold expression, we can use the [`v:lnum`][v:lnum] variable to access the line number of the current line that is being evaluated. This can easily be combined with the [`getline()`][getline] function to get the *contents* of the current line that's being evaluated.

## Customizing the `foldtext`

We can customize the way that a fold looks by way of the [`foldtext`][foldtext] option. Here's the boilerplate foldtext expression that we used to begin with:

```viml
function! MarkdownFoldText()
  return getline(v:foldstart)
endfunction
setlocal foldtext=MarkdownFoldText()
```

Inside of a foldtext expression, we can use the [`v:foldstart`][v:foldstart] and [`v:foldend`][v:foldend] variables, which reference the line numbers of the first and last lines that make up the current fold.
