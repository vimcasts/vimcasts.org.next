[Vspec][vspec] is a library that allows you to test-drive your Vimscript code. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics: how to inspect the contents of a buffer, how to simulate the actions of a user, and how to invoke user-defined mappings.

Vspec lets you write tests for you Vimscript code, following a format that resembles [rspec][]. We can use a `describe` block to specify a context, then wrap each individual test in an `it` block. Each of these blocks is closed with an `end` keyword, just like in ruby:

```viml
describe 'vspec'
  it 'is inspired by rspec'
  end
end
```

Check out Kana Natsuno's blog post for instructions on [how to set up a Vim plugin to be tested by vspec][setup].

### Sample code

Here's the vspec code that was demonstrated in the video:

```viml
nnoremap x daw

describe 'vspec'

  before
    new
    put! = 'Welcome to Vimcasts'
  end

  after
    close!
  end

  it 'can read the contents of the buffer'
    Expect getline(1) == "Welcome to Vimcasts"
  end

  it 'feels just like operating Vim!'
    normal gg$
    normal daw
    Expect getline(1) == 'Welcome to'
    Expect getreg('"') == ' Vimcasts'
  end

  it 'can exercise user-defined mappings'
    normal gg$
    normal x
    Expect getline(1) == 'Welcome to'
    Expect getreg('"') == ' Vimcasts'
  end

end
```

### :normal Vs :normal!

In the demo, I used the [`:normal` command][normal]. It's worth noting that the `:normal!` command, when used with a trailing bang, will avoid user-defined mappings. That's useful if you want to invoke built-in functionality. For example, if we had used `:normal! x` in our vspec test, then it would have invoked [Vim's built-in `x` command][x], ignoring our custom mapping.

In [Learn Vimscript the Hard Way][lvsthw29], Steve Losh says "when writing Vim scripts you should always use normal!, and never use plain old normal". This is good advice when writing plugin functionality, but you can disregard it when writing vspec tests for that same plugin. If you want to test the functionality of a user-defined mapping, then `:normal` (without the bang) is the way to do it.
